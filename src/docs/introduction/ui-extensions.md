While DatoCMS offers a great number of fields with different appearance configurations, we cannot cover every possible scenario. UI Extensions enable developers to replace the default fields that DatoCMS provides with third-party HTML5 applications, so the editing experience of our administrative backend can be fully customized.

### When is it useful to use them?

#### Better authoring experience

When the fields provided by DatoCMS do not meet the specific requirements of your content editors, UI Extensions can be created to customize the DatoCMS administrative area to fit the authors' needs. Some examples might be:

* To make JSON data editable using a custom interface;
* Displaying the difference between draft and published states of a field,
* A way to have some field calculated based on some others.

#### Third-party integrations

You can also use UI Extensions to communicate with external APIs and integrate third-party data in DatoCMS, for example:

* Translating text from one locale to other locales using external translation APIs,
* Fetching product details from an external e-commerce website (Shopify, Commerce Layer) and embedding it in DatoCMS.

### Next steps

If you're a developer, you can learn how to build new UI Extensions or integrate existing ones [in our detailed guide](/docs/ui-extensions/introduction/).
